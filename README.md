# Practice testing AI/ML based applications
Software testers can use the apps in this repo to practice testing applications that us AI and Machine Learning. Most professional testers do not get the chance to wet their feet at testing real AI/ML based applications. Even when motivated testers pick a random application and try testing, the applications and features seem too vast and opaque to test methodically. To get past this, we have developed some simple AI/ML based applications that do just one or two things well enough to challenge a professional tester. Your exercise will be to test the application and discuss your ideas with other testers. The applications listed have been developed and maintained by [Qxf2 Services](https://www.qxf2.com/?utm_source=qa-aiml-github-readme&utm_medium=click&utm_campaign=From%20QA%20AIML).

### LOCAL SETUP
1. Create a virtual environment for yourself (we used Python 3.7)
2. Activate the virtual environment
3. Install required Python modules `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3a. Type `python` to bring up the Python interpreter of your virtualenv
3b. `import nltk` and then `nltk.download('stopwords')`
3c. Exit out of the Python interpreter
4. Start the server `python ai_ml_app.py`
5. Visit http://localhost:6464 on your Browser
6. Read through the home page displayed to learn more about this application

### We would love to hear from you!
We are professional testers who are learning how to test AI/ML based applications. We are not experts. We do not have the right answers. In fact, we struggle! But we make an honest attempt to practice and improve. And we share our work on our [blog](https://qxf2.com/blog) and speak openly about the troubles we have testing more complex applications and the solutions we try out at our clients. So, if you are a tester on a journey similar to ours, please reach out and share your ideas, difficulties and thoughts. Reach out to us either on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/qxf2-services) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@Qxf21) or email me (Arun: mak@qxf2.com) directly.
